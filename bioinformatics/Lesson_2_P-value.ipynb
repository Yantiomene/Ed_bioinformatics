This means that there is a 4% chance of finding a difference as large as (or larger than) the one that you obtained, given that the null hypothesis is true. In terms of significance, typically a p-value of 0.05 is used as the threshold. This is interpreted as, assuming that the null hypothesis is true, if there is a 5% chance or less of observing a difference as extreme (or larger) as you observed, you would reject the null hypothesis, and accept the alternative hypothesis. Alternately, if the probability was greater than 0.05, you would fail to reject the null hypothesis.
